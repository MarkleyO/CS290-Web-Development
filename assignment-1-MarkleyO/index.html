		<h2>Questions and Answers</h2>
			<p>My confidence is at a 1, I've seen html code, but never done any work with it.</p>
			<p>I hope to learn how to develop the code which runs websites, as well as learn how to work on the design/layout of sites. I also hope to come out with a greater understanding of how the internet works.</p>
