<h2>10/1</h2>
<p> My challenges and troubles were trying to remember the names of all the tags, but other than that the assignment was fairly straight forward, and allowed me to get used to the general format and feel of html. looking at example code from lecture helped me remember how to structure </p>
<p> I learned how I personally like my html code to look, so that it is easy for me to navigate my own work. </p>
<p> On this assignment the published notes, as well as a couple web articles to look up an unfamiliar tag, were all that I used to complete the assignment. </p>
